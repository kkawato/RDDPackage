Description: Implements safe policy learning under regression discontinuity designs
    with multiple cutoffs, based on Zhang et al. (2022) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.13323>.
    The learned cutoffs are guaranteed  to perform no worse than the existing
    cutoffs in terms of overall outcomes. The 'rdlearn' package also includes
    features for visualizing the learned cutoffs relative to the baseline and
    conducting sensitivity analyses.
