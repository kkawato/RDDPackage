Title: Safe Policy Learning under RD Design with Multiple Cutoffs
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    c(person(given = "Kentaro",
           family = "Kawato",
           role = c("cre"),
           email = "kentaro1358nohe@gmail.com"),
    person(given = "Yi",
           family = "Zhang",
           role = c("aut")))
Description: The rdlearn offers tools for safe policy learning under regression 
    discontinuity designs with multiple cutoffs. The learned cutoffs are 
    guaranteed to perform no worse than the existing cutoffs in terms of overall 
    outcomes.Additionally, this package allows you to visualize the learned 
    cutoffs relative to the baseline and perform sensitivity analysis.
