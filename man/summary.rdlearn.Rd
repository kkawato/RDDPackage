\title{Summary function}
\usage{
\method{summary}{rdlearn}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{rdlearn} returned by the
\code{\link{rdlearn}} function.}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
Displays key outputs from the \code{\link{rdlearn}} function. It
  provides basic information and RD causal effect estimates from
  \code{\link{rdestimate}}, as well as the safe cutoffs derived by
  \code{\link{rdlearn}} and the difference between them and the original
  cutoffs.

Summary function

\examples{
# Load the simulation data
data(simdata_A)

# Learn new treatment assignment cutoffs
rdlearn_result <- rdlearn(
  y = "Y", x = "X", c = "C", data = simdata_A,
  fold = 2, M = c(0, 1), cost = 0
)

# Summarise the learned policies
summary(rdlearn_result)

# Visualize the learned policies
plot(rdlearn_result, opt = "dif")

# Implement sensitivity analysis
sens_result <- sens(rdlearn_result, M = 1, cost = c(0, 1))
plot(sens_result, opt = "dif")
